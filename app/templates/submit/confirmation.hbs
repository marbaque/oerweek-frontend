<h1>Supporting all Learners</h1>
<p>We seek to ensure that all Open Education Week activities and contributions are accessible to all learners.  The following best practices from the National Center for Disabilities and Access to Education are highly recommended:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide alternative text for non-textual items including images and audio</li>
  <li>Make sure that content is well structured and clearly written</li>
  <li>Provide headers for data tables</li>
  <li>Ensure hyperlinks make sense out of context</li>
  <li>Caption and/or provide transcripts for videos</li>
  <li>Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning</li>
  <li>Ensure users can complete and submit all forms</li>
</ul>
